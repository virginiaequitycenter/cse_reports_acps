# Albemarle County Public Schools Career Self-Efficacy and Outcome Expectations
## School-Wide Reports
This repository contains the building blocks for a series of Career Self Efficacy and
Outcome Expectations Reports generated by the Center for Community Partnerships in 
collaboration with Albemarle County Public Schools. 7th and 8th grade ACPS students in 
Fall of 2023 and 2024 completed the Middle School Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES) (Fouad et al., 1997)
and results were analysed by school, racial groups, and student membership groups. 

## How to use this repository
Each year's data collection exists in its own folder. Each year's folder contains the code to 
clean the original data sources as well as create plots specific to each middle school
and ACPS middle school students as a whole. Lastly, each folder contains the final reports
generated for ACPS stakeholders. 

Both the raw data and the cleaned data have been omitted to protect student privacy.
Student groups with fewer than 10 observations have also been repressed to maintain
FERPA guidelines.
